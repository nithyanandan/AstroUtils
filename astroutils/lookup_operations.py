    remove_oob
            [boolean] If set to True, results of nearest neighbour search and 
            lookup are returned only for those input locations which have a 
            neighbour within the distance upper bound. Locations with no 
            neighbours inside the distance upper bound will not be in the 
            returned results. Default = True. If set to False, even if no 
            nearest neighbours are found within the distance upper bound, an
            infinite distance and out of bound index from the lookup table are
            returned.

    Outputs: 

    Returns a tuple of nearest neighbour lookup value, the index of nearest
    neighbour location in the lookup table and nearest neighbour distance in 
    the lookup table. The tuple consists of the following elements in this 
    order. The number of pairs matched will be the lesser of those determined 
    by distNN and the nearest match

    ibind   [numpy vector] indices of the input locations (ngbrof) for which 
            nearest neighbours were found from the lookup table. If remove_oob is 
            not set to True, size of ibind is equal to N (the number of 
            locations in ngbrof, otherwise size of ibind is less than or equal 
            to N. Values of ibind equal to size of lookup table values indicates 
            the nearest neighbours for the corresponding input location could 
            not be found within the distance upper bound from the lookup table. 
            The corresponding values in distNN are returned as inf or NP.inf

    nnval   [numpy vector] nearest neighbour lookup values for the given input
            locations. If remove_oob is not set to True, size of nnval is equal
            to N, otherwise size of nnval is less than or equal
            to N. In such a case, out of bound locations are
            filled with oob_value. Corresponding values in distNN are returned 
            as inf or NP.inf

    distNN  [numpy vector] distance to the nearest neighbour in the lookup table
            for the given input locations. If remove_oob is not set to True, size 
            of distNN is equal to N (number of locations in ngbrof), otherwise 
            size of distNN is less than or equal to N. In such 
            a case, out of bound locations are filled with inf or NP.inf.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Find all nearest neighbours of one set of locations in another set of 
    locations within a specified distance. 

    Inputs:

    ngbrof    [numpy array] Locations for nearest neighbours are to be 
              determined. Has dimensions MxK where M is the number of locations.

    ngbrin    [numpy array] Locations from which nearest neighbours are to be 
              chosen for the locations in ngbrof. Has dimensions NxK.

    distance_ULIM
              [scalar] Maximum search radius to look for neighbours. 
              Default=NP.inf

    flatten   [boolean] If set to True, flattens the output of the nearest
              neighbour search algorithm to yield two separate sets of matching
              indices - one for ngbrof and the other for ngbrin. Default=False

    parallel  [boolean] specifies if parallelization is to be invoked. False 
              (default) means only serial processing. Parallelization is done
              over ngbrof

    nproc     [scalar] specifies number of independent processes to spawn.
              Default=None, means automatically determines the number of 
              process cores in the system and use one less than that to 
              avoid locking the system for other processes. Applies only 
              if input parameter 'parallel' (see above) is set to True. 
              If nproc is set to a value more than the number of process
              cores in the system, it will be reset to number of process 
              cores in the system minus one to avoid locking the system out 
              for other processes

    Outputs:

    List containing three items. The first item is a list of M lists where each 
    of the M inner lists corresponds to one entry in ngbrof and the elements in 
    the inner list contains indices to ngbrin that are the nearest neighbours of 
    that specific ngbrof (same as output of cKDTree.query_ball_tree()). The 
    second item in the output list is a numpy array of indices to ngbrof 
    (obtained from the first item if input keyword flatten is set to True) or 
    None (if input keyword flatten is set to False). The third item in the output 
    list is a numpy array of indices to ngbrin that is a valid neighbour of

    True) or None (if input keyword flatten is set to False).
